# North Ambria

Pain, starvation and suffering were your childhood. From an esteemed principality to a third world state, you don't know if it would be worse to have known its former glory or to have been born in its current misery. It forged you into cold steel, able to survive any harsh condition, for the only two things that matter are yourself, and  the North. The skies are full of omens, each painted in blood.

### Personnality Trait (d8)
1. Don't trust outsiders. All they want is drag us further down
2. The slightest sight of salt terrifies/angers me. I know. I saw it.
3. Jaegers are my heroes. Spitting on them means spitting on home.
4. The Septian Church hides something from us. And I will find out what.
5. I was there. Each day, I look at the skies, shivering, waiting for it to return.

### Ideals (d6)
1. Rebuild Ambria. The time for suffering is over. I will do anything to bring back Ambria to its former glory. (Good)
2. Revenge. I must hunt the members/descendant of the Devil Family. They will pay in blood for leaving their people to die. (Evil)
3. Glory. From rags to riches. I must elevate myself from the ashes of my country.
4. Memory. I must uncover the truth about the disaster at all costs, and let the world know.
