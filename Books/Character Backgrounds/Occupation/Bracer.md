*The Bracer is the supporting gauntlet, and its goal is to help people, no matter the time and place*

The Bracer Guild is a non-governmental organisation, tasked with helping people when they need, without the selfishness of governments or the allegiances of armies. 
A Bracer can come from any background, and is usually proficient at defending himself and others, if possible with a good head on his shoulders.
Sometimes, some Bracers are more akin to legendary warriors, like Arios McLaine or Cassius Bright, while some keep a lower profile, living a vagrant life from branch to branch like Toval Randonneur or Scheherazad Harvey. They are usually considered jacks of all trades, able to fend back wild beast or skillfully negociate to defuse a potentially dangerous situation.


Guild branches usually contain a reception with an orbal phone, and several boards where people can post their requests.

Founded officially in S.1152 in the Leman state, though its origins lies in the Middle Ages. Not tied to governements or countries, the Guild has branches in a lot of cities throughout Zemuria, though they can be seen as an infringement on the army's duty depending on the country.

**Liberl** : As it is a mostly rural country, Bracers are quintessential to the wellbeing of the kingdom, though their relationship to the army are a bit tense at time. Home of Cassius Bright, S Rank
