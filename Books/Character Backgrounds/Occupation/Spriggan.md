## Description
Spriggans are underground Calvardian operators, and can be seen as a kind of more cynical approach to the Bracer Guild.
Spriggans usually offer their services from back-alley offices or personnal meeting, and their services can vary quite a lot from Spriggan to Spriggan, ranging from finding lost or stolen objects, missing persons, negociation, even extending in extreme cases to theft or even murder.
In Calvard, it is not uncommon for ex-Jaegers or military to become Spriggans to make some extra money
