# General Principles
A tactical orbment is one of the most valuable uses of orbal energy. Its appearance is that of a large stopwatch (at least for first gen tac orbments), with seven slots linked by lines.

It is possible to fill its slots with elemental quartz, refined from sepith by orbal engineers, and doing so allows two useful effects :

- Generation of an Orbal Enhancement Field : Depending on the nature of the quartz set into the orbment, generating this energy field enhances the user's physical and mental capacities, making him faster, stronger, or more resilient. This application is generally favored by close quarters fighters, as it is far simpler than the second.

- Manifestation of Orbal Arts : by following precise patterns on the orbment's power lines, it is possible to start manipulating the nature of the Orbal field, imbuing it with various properties, of an offensive or supporting nature. Then, by maintaining concentration, it is possible to project this shaped orbal energy into what is called an Orbal Art, essentially a replication of the magic of our far gone ancestors. Using Orbal Arts is a true feat, but provides a strong advantage during fights.

It is mandatory to have it tuned to your body in order to be able to generate an Orbal Field or cast Arts. This can generally be done by a sufficiently skilled orbal engineer, where it is also possible to change the quartz you want to use.

# Elemental Sepith and its influence

Earth : Physical Defense
Water : Recovery, defense from Arts
Fire : Physical Offense
Wind : Movement, Evasion
Time : Action Speed
Space : Accuracy, EP Cost
Mirage (Cognition) : Total EP, Arts Offense
