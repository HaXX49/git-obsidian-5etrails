# 1. History of the Liberl Kingdom
As ancient as the Septian Calendar itself, the Kingdom of Liberl is a safe haven of peace situated in the south west of the Zemurian continent.

Initially starting as a class-based monarchy, tension between commoners and nobles were common occurences for quite a long time. It culminated circa S1100, with the great Grancel Insurrection, a long string of skirmishes at first, escalating into a true war in the streets.
This period of critical unrest lasted for several weeks, almost breaking into a civil war. Finally, the crown princess Cecillia von Auslese decided to hold a meeting between the most influential figures of this time, each representing one of the cities of Rolent, Bose, Ruan, Zeiss and Grancel.

Surprisingly, what came of this meeting was a decision that would change the face of this kingdom forever : the abolition of all class priviledges.
Each major city and its surrounding region would elect a mayor, and the Queen would meet with them each month to discuss and plan with them most aspects of the kingdom's life. While uncertain at first, the people quickly realised that this simpler way of life was one that would guide them through simpler and more peaceful time.

In S1192 though, the Erebonian Empire [REDACTED] and attacked the Liberl Kingdom by surprise, quickly bringing it on its knees, only leaving the Grancel Region unoccupied. Much to their surprise, the Leiston Fortress became the centerpiece of a string of daring counter-attacks, coordinated by the brilliant Lieutenant-General Bright and General Morgan, revolving around the unveiling of the airship Arseille, what is still known today as the fastest ship in all of Zemuria, the White Wings of Liberl. A hundred days later, a peace and non-aggression treaty was signed by both Queen Alicia von Auslese II and Emperor Eugent Reise Arnor III.

Having witnessed their fair share of wars, the liberlian are mostly pacifists. Life in the kingdom is kept quite simple, even after the Orbal Revolution, most cities living on local resources like Septium mining in the Rolent Region or fishing in Ruan.
Nevertheless, technical innovation is one of Liberl's strength, with Zeiss Central Factory being renowned all throughout the continent as equals of the Verne Company or the Reinford Group, with their crowning achievement being the Arseille.

The scars of the Hundred-Days War being still very fresh, the Liberlian Royal Army is very active, mostly at checkpoint on the border like the Haken Gate or Wolf Fortress.
In spite of that, the preferred method of resolving conflicts and problems throughout the countries is through the Bracer Guild. Nevertheless, though they have the people's trust, their relations with the Army are quite tense.
