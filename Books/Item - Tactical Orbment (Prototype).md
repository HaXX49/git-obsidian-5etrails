A complicated looking device resembling a mechanical watch. A prototype for the first generation of battle orbments, designed by Professor Russel at ZCF. 

Depending on the quartz fitted inside its circuits, it can produce two effects :

***Orbal Field.*** When switched up, the orbment's internal mechanism create a thin orbal field, making its user stronger, faster or tougher depending on the quartz circuit. The quartz fitted inside the orbment apply different effects on your character during battle.

***Orbal Art***. During battle, it is possible to trace glyphs on the orbment's power lines to shape, amplify and project its orbal field, giving it offensive, defensive, augmentative or debilitating effects. Holding the battle orbment during battle allows casting orbal arts, each requiring a somatic cost and EP (we'll see later) cost. Concentration must be maintained during the casting of the art.
