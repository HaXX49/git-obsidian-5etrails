*"That brief hesitation was all it took to spawn a great evil. It crawled through the fields, ran through the hills, and spread disaster in the skies above."*
\- Book of Ezer, Verse 2, "Disaster Unleashed"

The **Septian Church**, implanted throughout all of Zemuria, is possibly the most powerful organisation of the continent, rivaled only by Ouroboros.
It is said that the Church was established at the end of the Dark Ages, and actually was the greatest force of the continent, cementing most countries as we know them today.
Its first goal is essential : education. Besides great universities like Thors, most of the continent's education, especially at a young age, is done through sunday school.
They also are the "only" public users of magic, or at least something akin to it : Thaumaturgy. Its powers are real, though its source is unknown. Examples of Thaumaturgy include curation, and light influence on beings.

Unknown to the majority, they also take great care of seeking active Artifacts, objects imbued with some form or magic, or unknown technology from the Zemurians. This mission is of course not carried by normal priests, but by a secret division of the Congregation for the Sacrments, known only as the **Gralsritter**.
Members of the Gralsritter, or knights, look inconspicuous from the outside, usually passing as wandering priests, monks or sisters, but actually are adept warriors and adventurers. They are well versed in Thaumaturgy, and carry special weapons from the church, like bowguns, templar swords or hidden blades, as well as special armors or clothing, crafted through methods known only to the Congregation.
If the mission requires it, Knights can be assisted by Squires, who can be either knights in training, or logistics specialists.

At the top of the Gralsritter lies one of the deepest and well kept hidden mysteries of the church : the **Dominions**.

**Dominions** is a council of twelve exceptionnally gifted knights leading the Gralsritter, who have manifested an accursed mark, known as a **Stigma**, through extreme trauma.
Though the exact nature of the Stigmas is unknown, a knight who manifests one undergoes rigorous training in order to master it, as Stigmas drain heavily their users, or can outright kill them.
Stigmas themselves are studied intensely by the Congregation for Sacraments, as their nature is quite bizarre. According to their records, since the Dark Ages, no more than the same 12 Stigmas manifest in this world. If a Dominion is killed, his Stigma will manifest in another person eventually.
While Thaumaturgy is quite a tame art, Stigma-induced powers are capable of ungodly destruction (cf 5th Dominion's mission reports regarding the Spear of Loa), with example such as the Partitioner's manipulation of space itself, the transmutation abilities of the Akashic Arm or the mission report mentioning the Spear of Loa wiping out five whole companies of a Jaeger corps.
Once properly trained, Dominions are called upon for only the most dangerous missions, commanding tactical teams of knights and squires, and are also assigned their own Merkabahs, technologically anachronous ships capable of flight, dogfight, and optical dissimulation serving as a mobile base of operation and mean of transportation (It is theorized that Merkabahs were invented through intense study of an artifact known as the Heavenly Chariot and covert contracts with the Zeiss Central Factory, Reinford Group, and the Verne Corporation). A parting word about the Dominions is that whenever the twelve Stigmas have not manifested, it is the Gralsritter most vital mission to ensure that they are the firsts to find the missing Stigmas, or silence an unworthy Stigma user, for its misuse could have apocalyptic consequences.

At the heart of the Church, far from the public eyes, lie some of the most important secrets of our times :
- **Study of the Great Mystery** : The Great Mystery is the lie that forms the base of the Church ; The existence of the Godess Aidios is only theorized, but has never been proven. In a world that went through the Dark Ages, subject to the world-bending forces of the Septerrions and the powers of the artifacts, the vast ruin that was Zemuria at that time needed a benevolent force to put it together and rebuild it.
  A simple answer to this complex question was religion. 
  At the end of the Dark Ages, a small group of scholars acquired an artifact dubbed the Graal of Eidos. Its powers weren't impressive, mostly being centered around minor healing, but they could be channeled through objects linked to it. 
  They then decided to wander around the continent in order to unite people once again, but a divergence through the mean to unification arose, leading to a split into two rival groups :
  - **Ouranos**, wanted to create a new god named Aidios, that truly belonged to humanity, and silence once and for all the Septerrions and artifacts. As you can guess, this group would later become the Septian Church.
  - **Ouroboros** on the other hand wanted humanity to seize absolute control over the unnatural forces that plagued them for so many years. They too still exist to this day, in the shadows of the world.
- **The Beyond** : This term refers to at least one possible other world, which has been known to intersect with Zemuria at some times (cf. the Graal of Erebos, or the D∴G cult incidents). The monsters that happened to be set free upon Zemuria came to be known as demons, inspiring about a millenia of Septian mythology. This also coincides with the strange reportings of the orbal ship *Amberl Light* ; A heavy wall of unpenetrable fog seems to circle the entirety of Zemuria at this moment. It is absolutely unkown what lies ahead.
  It is also possible that some exploitable points of contact with the Beyond exist, like the pocket of non-space that previously housed the Liber Ark (cf. Liberl Incident Report, 5th Dominion) or the "Reverie Corridor" (cf. Class VII - First Year Report, 8th Dominion) located in Thors Military Academy. 

Ultimately, it is our sacred mission since the times of Ouranos to locate and handle any otherworldly threat to the world we helped building.
